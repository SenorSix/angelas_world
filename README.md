My first Flask app. Started from a basic Python course but quickly turned into a hands-on project where I figured out how to connect Python with HTML and CSS. This was the turning point where I took a couple python tutorials and made them into full stack projects so I could understand the process. The tutorials weren't teaching that. Inadvertently made the site dynamic without realizing it at first. I was just trying to make a simple site with links.
